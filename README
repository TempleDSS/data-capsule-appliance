GENERAL SETUP
--------------------------------------------------

To prepare these scripts for use, give them a fixed location and, optionally,
add them to the PATH variable of the user that will be invoking them (so that
the full path need not be given for each invocation). Finally, run the following commands to prepare the tapinit program for use (note that these require root privilege to set up):

# chown root:kvm tapinit
# chmod ug+s tapinit


IMAGE SETUP (Linux)
--------------------------------------------------

To set up a Linux image to work with these scripts, one must add the contents
of "new.rc.local" to the /etc/rc.local script within the image.
