# Data Capsule Appliance Host

This projects provides the code for automating the Data Capsule Host deployment. 

## Getting Started

Clone this repo using 

```
git clone https://github.com/Data-to-Insight-Center/Data-Capsule-Appliance-Host.git
```

### Prerequisites

#### Machine used for provisioning with Ansible
You need to install Ansible in the machine that you are using for host provisioning. Refer to http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html for more details. 

Install python and python passlib module (http://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) in the same machine. 

#### Target machine (Where DC would be deployed)

In the target machine, you need to have ssh and python installed (for Ansible).

You need to have an account (<login_username>) to login in to the target machine with sudo access. 

### Deploying

1. Add the IP Addresses of the hosts that you need to provision in to the hosts file. 

2. Then run the following command inside the cloned directory. Be sure to replace the <login_username> with your remote username. 

```
ansible-playbook --user=<login_username> -k -i hosts site.yml --ask-become-pass
```

3. Then you will be prompted to enter two password as following. Enter the login remote user password for the first prompt and that user's
sudo password for the second prompt.

```
SSH password:<login_user_password>
SUDO password[defaults to SSH password]:<login_user_sudo_password>
```

This would start up the provisioning of the host machine! You should not see any errors in the terminal when this is being executed. 

4. After provisioning the machine, you need to add the iptable rules to your existing iptables(/etc/sysconfig/iptables) file. 
IPtable rules required for the Data Capsule will be available at /etc/sysconfig/iptables_dataCapsule in the provisioned host. 


### Result

The aforementioned steps would provision the target machine creating a DC hosting user with the default password (in group_vars/all file).

Then you can login into this user and deploy the Data Capsule or deploy the DC Api. 

## Configurations

All the variables for the configurations can be found at the following file.
```
group_vars/all
```
