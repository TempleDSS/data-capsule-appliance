# Data Capsule Appliance
This repository contains components necessary to set up and run a data capsule appliance - an environment for providing secure access to restricted collections. The repository is organized as follows:

* Data Capsule Guest Directory contains all the files required to Build the guest DC VM image.
* Data Capsule Host Directory contains all the files required for the Host and Target Machine setup.
* HTRC Dependencies contains all the necessary DC setup script files forked from HTRC.

### [Wiki](https://github.com/TempleDSS/data-capsule-appliance/wiki)

The Wiki contains directions for implementing the data capsule.

## Background 

This appliance was adapted from [HTRC's data capsules](https://github.com/htrc/HTRC-DataCapsules) through an IMLS grant. Prior work in this direction, including documentation relating to HTRC's repo, are available on [Data-to-Insight](https://data-to-insight-center.github.io/data-capsule-appliance/intro/).
