# negotiator-cli
Tool for interacting with negotiator (https://github.com/xolox/python-negotiator) guests via CLI

# Why?

Negotiator host requires libvirt. But its possible to use negotiator-guest without negotiator-host running in host machine. Current Negotiator implementation doesn't support this.
