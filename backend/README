GENERAL SETUP
--------------------------------------------------

To prepare these scripts for use, give them a fixed location and, optionally,
add them to the PATH variable of the user that will be invoking them (so that
the full path need not be given for each invocation). Finally, run the
following commands to prepare the tapinit program for use (note that these
require root privilege to set up):

# chown root:kvm tapinit
# chmod ug+s tapinit

qemu-ifup must be modified so that the SCRIPT_DIR variable points to the
directory containing the backend scripts.  Also, qemu-ifup must be moved to
/etc/ (there may be an existing version there; it is probably safe to overwrite
it), and the account that will be running the scripts must be able to run the
sshfwd.sh and fw.sh scripts via sudo without a password.  To configure this,
add the following line to the sudoers file:

<USERNAME>  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: <SCRIPT_DIRECTORY>/sshfwd.sh, NOPASSWD: <SCRIPT_DIRECTORY>/fw.sh

Make sure this line is after any lines about the sudo and admin groups,
otherwise those rules will supercede this one and it will not work.  This
should not, however, be an issue since the user running the scripts should not
require root access for anything else, and that is the recommended security
practice.

GUEST REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

There are currently no special modifications required for a guest VM image.
This may change in the future.  The only recommended modification is the
installation of an SSH daemon to facilitate SSH connections over the forwarded
port.
